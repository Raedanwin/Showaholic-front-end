# Showaholic-front-end

Technologies used: </hr>
  I used React and Skeleton for my front end and Flask and PostSQL for my backend.
  
Link to live site: </hr>
  I couldn't deploy it to heroku so no link.

Unsolved problems: </br>
  1. Some routes by still be tangled, I think I sorted them all out but there could still be some that don't go to the right spot. </br>
  2. Editing a show for some reason doesn't take the edit, I don't know exactly what's going on there. </br>
  3. Creating a show also doesn't properly post. Again, don't know what's going on there. </br>
  
Features I wasn't able to get to: </br>
  1. Showing 10 shows/movies below the search bar.</br>
  2. Actually showing where to watch whatever you searched for (the whole point of this project).</br>
  3. User authentication.</br>
  4. Saving something to a watchlist.</br>
  5. Check-list for the episodes and seasons (which I don't know how possible will be with my current API).</br>
  
Improvements I would make: </br>
  1. Fixing my unsolved problems (obviously). </br>
  2. Adding everything that I should have had, but wasn't able to get to.</br>
